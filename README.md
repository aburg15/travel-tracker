# Travel Tracker!
Travel Tracker! is an application that allows users to view their trips.  Upon logging in to the webpage, a user will be able to view their prior trips and future trips.  Trips can be filtered down to pending trips and approved trips if they choose to do so.  In addition to viewing existing trip information, a user has the option to post a new trip or receive a price quote based on the trip information entered by the user.
